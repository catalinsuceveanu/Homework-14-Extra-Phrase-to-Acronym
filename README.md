# Homework-14-Extra-Phrase-to-Acronym
Convert a phrase to its acronym. Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms)!
Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a long name like 

Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG)
“First In, First Out” -> FIFO
“Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor” -> CMOS
“Rolling On The Floor Laughing So Hard That My Dogs Came Over And Licked Me” -> ROTFLSHTMDCOALM
“Something - I made up from thin air” -> SIMUFTA
“Halley’s Comet” -> HC
“The Road _Not_ Taken” - > TRNT
“Ruby on Rails” -> ROR

Write a static method which takes in the phrase and returns the acronym. Write parameterized unit tests to try the method. Don’t write a program with a main method to test it; unit tests are enough.
